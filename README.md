## The Flutter aspects addressed

There is many aspects of Flutter addressed in this project : 
- Stateless/Stateful widgets
- Design patterns : Refactoring, Observer
- Classes
- Route system
- Communication parent-child (in both ways)
- Provider (Consumer, Listeners)
- Communication with [API REST](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos)
